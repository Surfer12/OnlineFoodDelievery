Task Distribution - Group Name: Struggle Bus


Project Overview
Tasks will be divided into individual components that each team member will implement while collaborating with others. Each member will ensure that OOP principles are demonstrated throughout their portion of the project design.

Core OOP Principles Focus
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Project Component Distribution
