To ensure that all methods and classes are properly integrated and tested, we'll review the codebase, make necessary adjustments, and highlight areas that need attention. Below are the steps and changes grouped by file to maintain a streamlined and effective CLI application.

1. Integrate DriverServiceImpl with DriverManager
[DriverManager.java`](file:///%60/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/managers/DriverManager.java%60)
Modify DriverManager to utilize DriverServiceImpl for driver operations.

DriverManager.java+10-4
2. Update Main Application Entry Point
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/app/Application.java
Modify Application to start the CLI application.

Application.java
3. Adjust Build Configuration in build.gradle
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/build.gradle
Ensure the correct main class is specified and remove unused dependencies.

build.gradle
4. Utilize InputValidationUtils Across the Application
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/validation/InputValidationUtils.java
Ensure utility methods are used consistently for input validation.

InputValidationUtils.java
5. Ensure ConsoleInputHandler Handles Inputs Effectively
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/validation/ConsoleInputHandler.java
Verify that input handling is robust and integrates with validation utilities.

ConsoleInputHandler.java
6. Confirm Driver Class Supports Required Operations
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/model/Driver.java
Check that Driver class methods are used appropriately for driver management.

Driver.java
7. Integrate OrderManager and MenuManager in DeliverySystemCLI
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/app/DeliverySystemCLI.java
Ensure that order and menu functionalities are properly connected in the CLI.

DeliverySystemCLI.java
8. Verify Order Processing in OrderManager
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/managers/OrderManager.java
Ensure that order creation and status updates are handled correctly.

OrderManager.java
9. Confirm Menu Selection in MenuManager
/Users/ryanoates/OnlineFoodDelievery/src/main/java/managers/MenuManager.java
Verify users can select menu items and quantities correctly.

MenuManager.java
10. Thoroughly Test the Application
Write Unit Tests:

Create test classes for each component to ensure functionality is working as expected.
Use JUnit and Mockito for testing various scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.
Perform Integration Testing:

Test the CLI application end-to-end to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
Simulate user inputs for different scenarios.
Handle Exceptions Gracefully:

Ensure that all try-catch blocks handle exceptions appropriately without crashing the application.
Log errors using the logger for debugging purposes.
By integrating all methods and classes properly and thoroughly testing each component, you can maintain a streamlined and effective CLI application. This ensures that your application is robust, user-friendly, and demonstrates the effectiveness of your codebase.

Note: Be sure to remove any unused code or dependencies, adhere to consistent coding standards, and document your code where necessary for better maintainability.

Create unit tests for OrderManager using JUnit and Mockito to ensure order processing works correctly.

OrderManagerTest.java+48-0
DriverManagerTest.java
Create unit tests for DriverManager to ensure driver operations are handled correctly.

DriverManagerTest.java
DeliverySystemCLITest.java
Create integration tests for DeliverySystemCLI to ensure end-to-end functionality.

DeliverySystemCLITest.java
DriverServiceImpl.java
Ensure that DriverServiceImpl is properly integrated and utilized within the application.

DriverServiceImpl.java
DeliverySystemCLI.java
